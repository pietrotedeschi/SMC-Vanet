## Statistical Model Checker for Opposite Direction in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
With UPPAAL-SMC, a Statistical Model Checker for Priced Timed Automata, we have defined a model able to simulate the Opposite Direction dissemination model for VANETs (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks).
Data dissemination in VANETs can be used to inform drivers or vehicles about traffic jams and to propagate emergency warnings among the vehicles (incident or accidents) to avoid any collision.
