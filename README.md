## Statistical Model Checker for Opposite Direction in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
UPPAAL-SMC is a Statistical Model Checker for Priced Timed Automata. In this project, we defined a model that allows to simulate the Opposite Direction dissemination model for VANETs (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks).
Data dissemination in VANETs can be used to inform drivers (or vehicles) about traffic jams and to propagate emergency warnings among the vehicles in order to avoid collisions.
